# Deploy-Anime-Quotes-App-To-GKE

Engineered a streamlined CI/CD pipeline using Terraform for Jenkins server setup and integrating it with a GitHub repository for automatic code retrieval and image deployment. The project advanced to deploying these Docker images on a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. A key feature was the use of a load balancer for public exposure of the service. The project was also documented through a YouTube video tutorial, highlighting both technical proficiency and ability to communicate complex processes.

To keep everything related to the project in one place, the Terraform code is included in this application's repository. Normally, it would be better to have it in a separate repository for clarity, but having it here simplifies management and access to all project parts.
